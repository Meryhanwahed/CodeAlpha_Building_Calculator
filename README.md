## Introduction to Fronted-End Development

Front-end development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application that users engage with directly in their web browsers. It involves using core technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure, style, and add interactivity to web pages. The goal is to build responsive and intuitive interfaces that provide a seamless user experience across different devices. Front-end developers often utilize frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, React, or Angular to streamline the development process, ensuring the website is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Task Overview

You’ll need to design a user interface with buttons for entering data and a display screen for displaying the results
